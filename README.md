        <h3>Problem / Data Domain</h3>
        <p>
            For many people in their 20s and above, keeping track of what pieces of clothing they own and how many pairs of shoes they have could result in a hectic ordeal. I want to be able to create a web app that organizes a person's closet. They'll be able to keep track of everything they have, as well as understand how much their items are worth and where to donate items if they don't want it anymore. Current web apps are not easy and not simple to navigate. Their layouts are old and difficult to manuever. They don't have the features that I am looking to add from a Streetwear standpoint. A close example of a competitor is <a href="https://smartcloset.me/">SmartCloset</a>. I also read a <a href="https://mgetsdressed.com/2018/09/10/wardrobe-inventory-and-outfit-logging-methods/">blogpost</a> detailing many ways of keeping track of a closet. Many of those methods seemed inefficient and are not a clear way of presenting a closet. Using my web app, people will be able to better represent what is in their closets and can be able to buy/sell/trade with friends online.

        <h3>App Description</h3>
        
            An important aspect of any webapp is the user base. Who are the users of My Closet?
            <ul>
                <li>People who want to keep track of what clothes and shoes they own</li>
                <li>Instagrammers who have their own online shop using Instagram to buy/sell/trade</li>
                <li>High Schoolers, College, Post-College</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>What kind of information will users be viewing and what will users do with the web app?</h3>
            <p>
                Users will mostly be inputting their own data to be viewed. This will create a profile for the item they are inputting. For example, if they wanted to add a pair of Nike Air Max 97s to their closet. A page will prompt them if they have a picture or not, ask them what color and size, the price that they paid for, and the condition of the shoe. After they have answered these questions, if there are any portions that haven't been filled out, they may go and fill it out later (for example, users don't need to immediately add a picture). Users may also explore and interact with other user profiles. They can buy/sell/trade with other users. Users may also decide to donate used clothing/shoes in an effort to reduce their carbon footprint. 
            </p>
            <h3>How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem?</h3>
            <p>
                This web app will be a strong solution in organizing a person's closet. It will also appeal to the Streetwear community, assisting in the buying/selling/trading of popular streetwear brands. It'll hopefully become a simple and modern web app, easily useable and accessible by all sorts of users.
